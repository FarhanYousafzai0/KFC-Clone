# KFC Website Clone

A static clone of the official KFC website. This project replicates the look and feel of KFC's homepage but is not fully responsive and may not adapt well on mobile devices or smaller screens. 

## Features

- **Homepage Layout**: The main landing page includes sections for menu items, special offers, and store locator.
- **Static Pages**: Key sections like the menu, promotions, and about page are recreated.
- **Images and Styling**: Includes images, fonts, and styles to closely resemble the original KFC website.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the website.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout of the pages.
- **JavaScript**: Some basic functionality and interactivity.

## Limitations

- **Non-Responsive**: This project is designed only for desktop viewing. It may not display correctly on mobile or tablet devices.
- **No Backend**: This clone is purely front-end. It does not include any backend functionalities or dynamic content.
- **Limited Interactivity**: Only a basic level of JavaScript is used, so some interactive features of the official KFC website may not be available.
